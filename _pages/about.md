I am a PhD student in the <a href='https://www.neuroengineering.uliege.be/'>Neuroengineering laboratory</a> of the <a href='https://www.montefiore.uliege.be/'>Montefiore Institute</a> of University of Li√®ge, under the supervision of <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/francialessioac/'> Alessio Franci</a> and <a href='https://people.montefiore.uliege.be/jmredoute/'>Jean-Michel Redout√©</a>. My research focuses on the design of low-power analog neuromophic integrated circuits implementing neuromodulation mechanisms. I am particularly interested in neuromorphic control and signal processing for robotics, biomedical applications, and brain-machine interfaces. I am currently funded by the <a href='https://www.frs-fnrs.be/en/financements/chercheur-doctorant#fria'>FRIA</a> grant from the Belgian National Fund for Scientific Research (F.R.S.-FNRS). I obtained my Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering with professional focus in Bioelectronics from the University of Li√®ge in 2022.
